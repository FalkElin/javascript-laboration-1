        <h1>Hello, i see you made the right choice.</h1>
        By drinking the blue potion you have been given the opportunity to enter
        the catchanted forest. Never before visited by humankind<br />
        Feel free to explore our world, interact with animals and plants. But be
        cat-scious, some of us don't like strangers.<br />
        Fun fact about this world is that every animal you see once belonged or
        does belong to the creator of this world, their behavior is similar to
        the humanworld version. My name is Molle and i'm a friendly cat that
        once walked the humanworld.
        <h3>
          To enter the world you click on the Crazycat, but first you must solve
          his riddle.
        </h3>
